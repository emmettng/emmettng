to be continued ...

out of domain prediction is a illusion brought by low dimensional problem. 

many point from why machine learning works
and 
how manchine learning works : VC dimension 

from the start point of 

when is  machine learning the  necessary solution 
of be part of the necessary solution.

Intuitive explaination
