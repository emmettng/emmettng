Linear model 
- linear classification 
- logistic regression : https://www.quora.com/Why-is-logistic-regression-considered-a-linear-model

Historical path 

- Regression ( all loss functions)
- Logistic regression (classification loss functions)
- why name regression 
- why name logistic
- Boltzmann distribution <=>  softmax 
- logstistic <=> crossentropy 


Note 
1. (x,y) >= 0 and (x,y)=0 <=> x = y . means uniqueness
2. (x,y) = (y,x) symmetric  ==> reversable, no time direction. 
3. triangle inequality ==> from A to B , visit C in the middel is always longer than from A direct to B ==> Defined Direct.
