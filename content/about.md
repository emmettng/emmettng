- I believe the nature prefers `simplicity` over complexity. 
- I believe the nature prefers `composition` over combination.
- I believe the nature prefers `flaw` over perfect.
- I believe the nature has **NO** preference. 

So `limited` information `interact` under `limited constraint` presents us a perfect world with complex combination of all pulzzes.

That's the way it works, not because it is better, it's because that is the only way. The way it works defines what it is.

It is hard to avoid being deceived by our perception or daily life experience

It is easy to feel content with what we are and where we are. 

If we due to be governed by certain natural laws, or behave under some universal constraints, I really would like to know what they are.
