Puzzles in this world should be understood rather than be remembered. 

It is hard to avoid being deceived by our perception or daily life experience

It is easy to feel content with the role we play and the achievement we have gained.

And I'm lucky enough to be who I am today. I know where the future is, hope I could get there a litter bit faster than others.

## I am a: 
 - Haskell & Category theory enthusiast. 
 - Machine Learning Researcher
 - Data analyst
