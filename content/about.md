- I believe the nature prefers `simplicity` over complexity. 
- I believe the nature has **NO** preference. 

So puzzles in this world could be understood rather than be remembered. 

It is hard to avoid being deceived by our perception or daily life experience

It is easy to feel content with the role we play and the achievement we have gained.

If we due to be governed by certain natural laws, or behave under some universal constraints, I really would like to know what they are.
