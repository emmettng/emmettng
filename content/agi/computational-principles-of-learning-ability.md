## No Free Lunch
```
A general-purpose universal optimization strategy is theoretically impossible,
and the only way one strategy can outperform another is if it is specialized to the objective function
```
In our daily life, there are many intuitive examples which reflect the notion of
NFL theorem. 

Normall

- we use coffee grinder to make coffee not juice extractor,
- we would like to wear soccer shoes while playing football not slippers.
- paratroopers are equipped with parachute not umbrella.
  
The fact that specific task requires specific solution is the most common knowledge which we take it for granted, and all these solutions are basically specialized optimization strategy for specific objective function.

**WE**  
In every using case of all specific strategies, there is an inevitable component.

- **We** identify the objective requirements.
- **We** decide or design what strategy will be used.
- **We** cooperate with all kinds of strategies designed by us. 
- **We** are drivers.
- **We** are pilots.
- **We** are captains.
- **we** are astronauts
  
The best way to guarantee the well functioning of a system is to integrate **HUMAN** with the task specific solution. 

**We** are the inevitable core part and ultimate information source which support
every specific strategy under exceptional circumstances.
**We** are the general purpose universal optimization strategy.

**SO** 
Does the existence of **us** disproved the NFL-theorem?

**Maybe** 

- There is an universal optimization strategy Z. 
- There is not any specific ”objective function” exists
before Z is being implemented.

**Maybe**

**We** are this optimization strategy Z, so **we** could define the existence of all objective functions, and **we** could draw the conclusion of NFL-theorem.
