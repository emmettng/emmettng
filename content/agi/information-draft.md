I was born in a small town in west central China. It was early 80s last century, Television is ... 

When I was about 6 years old, my family brough the first television, it could show only the grapy images. 

One thing that I remeber very clearly is that all western people looks the same. That really scae me a lot, at the beginning I though maybe there is something wrong with my brain, because that doesn't make any sences, I know they are people how could it be possible that they all have the same face. The most scarey thing is my mom has the same feeling. 

Aisan's eyes. 

graduatelly I can recognise them 

I don't sceary anymore when I cannot tell the differece of black people

many still confusing  " man de la (pinyin) effect "


I realise if only we put more focus we could see the differences. 


Why this happen ?
