### Programming 
- We decompose a complex problem into many factors. Hopefully, a composition of these factors would work as we expected and satisfy our requirements. 

    The problem is, we managed to construct these factors by developing and testing upon limited examples/requirements and tradition methodologies , such as OOP, fail to predicate the validity of arbitrary recomposition of these factors:
    - new way of composition could be unexpected
    - some factor upgrade for satisfying new requirement would break the consistency of other existing composition.

    We need paradigm which could help us regulate the consequence of factorization process. 

- Being able to do doesn't necessarily means will do.
    -  The way we reasoning and planing is far from being well structured or long-term effective. 
    - The wish of introducing benefit of functional paradigm to cooperate with our unsustainable habit is great. However, as long as there are **Simple** alternatives, we will inevitably regress to who we are and keep wishing shortly after.
    - **Simple** usually implies **Complexities / Difficulties in Installments**.



 We need to be forced to do **abstraction** the **Right** way.

### Everything out of Nothing

- Category theory.
    - As a researcher with sufficient computer science background but limited mathematical background, Haskell implementations would help me gaining deep understandings about many highly abstracted patterns.
