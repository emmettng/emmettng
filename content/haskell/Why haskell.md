### Engineering 
- Being able to do doesn't necessarily means will do.
    -  The way we reasoning and planing is far from being well structured or long-term effective. 
    - The wish of introducing benefit of functional paradigm to cooperate with our unsustainable habit is great. However, as long as there are **Simple** alternatives, we will inevitably regress to who we are and keep wishing shortly after.
    - **Simple** usually implies **Complexities / Difficulties in Installments**.

 We need to be forced to do **abstraction** the **Right** way.

### Everything out of Nothing

- Category theory.
    - As a researcher with sufficient computer science background but limited mathematical background, Haskell implementations would help me gaining deep understandings about many highly abstracted patterns.
