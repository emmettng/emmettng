1. Type families 
    1. type-level programming 
1. functional dependencies 

- [online discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14218453)
    What's the difference in motivation between doing things this way vs with functional dependencies?


    Type families are more general than fundeps, and can lead to simpler code with fewer extensions—FunctionalDependencies requires MultiParamTypeClasses, and often FlexibleInstances, FlexibleContexts, and UndecidableInstances.
    Fundeps are pretty clear for some simple examples (e.g., a container’s element type is uniquely determined by the container type), but in general I find it easier to think in terms of type-level functions than dependencies between types.

My understanding ... TODO
  - The mechanism adopted by Biological Learning System 


- I believe this is the explanation of biological level learning ability.
- Category theory.
    - As a researcher with sufficient computer science background but limited mathematical background, Haskell implementations would help me gaining more understandings about many highly abstracted patterns.
- Every Piece of information matters \
  `('Succ n)` 
  every piece of information matters in its own way 
  because if reduance exist you would recognize the difference and therefore there will be no reduance. 
    - The mechanism we adopt erased objective difference. (Biological Intelligence) generate more redunance recognition(eg. superstitious) epistemology 
    - If there is no ultimate different effect, then there is no difference at all. (Artificial Intelligence ) reduce unnecessary concept (science research). Ontology
   - combain epistemology and Ontology
