There was a serial killer. Whenever he encountered a problem of a specific domain,  he would kidnap people with corresponding expertise and locked them up in one of 100 rooms. Meanwhile there are 99 monkeys each being locked in one of the other 99 rooms. 

He then forward this task to the kidnapped expert and the other 99 monkeys. He decided that if he could tell the differences between works of the hostage and all these monkeys. He will release the hostage. Otherwise, he would follow his own bloody hobby. 

Unfortunately, after so many years, this serial killer has to keep suppressing his unspeakable dark desire. Because all these hostages could produce distinguishable (from monkey) work at easy.

Until one day, he need a solution from a data scientist. And all his could provide to the data scientist and monkeys are the record of task description and calculators.
