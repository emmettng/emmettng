There was an series killer who would kidnap people with different expertise and locked them up in one of 100 rooms. Meanwhile there are 99 monkeys each being locked in one of the other 99 rooms. 

Whenever this series killer encountered a problem of a specific domain. He would forward this task to the kidnapped expert and the other 99 monkeys. He decided that if he could tell the differences between the work of his hostage and the works of these monkeys. He will release the expert. Otherwise, he would follow his own bloody hobby. 

Unfortunetly, after so many years, the serise killer has to keep supressing his darkness desire. Because all these hostages could produce distingushable (from monkey) work at easy.

Finally, he got his lucky day. He need a solution from a data scientist. And all his could provide to the data scientist and monkeys are the task and calculators.
