There is a room 
each expert 10 times more monkeys.
goal for layman is to lock monkeys inside and free all experts.

based on the output to tell in 10 seconds. 

The task is simply to tell a specialist from a monkey.
Take whatever input given by people outside and produce desire output 

John Searle in December 2005
Searle's thought experiment begins with this hypothetical premise: suppose that artificial intelligence research has succeeded in constructing a computer that behaves as if it understands Chinese. It takes Chinese characters as input and, by following the instructions of a computer program, produces other Chinese characters, which it presents as output. Suppose, says Searle, that this computer performs its task so convincingly that it comfortably passes the Turing test: it convinces a human Chinese speaker that the program is itself a live Chinese speaker. To all of the questions that the person asks, it makes appropriate responses, such that any Chinese speaker would be convinced that they are talking to another Chinese-speaking human being.

The question Searle wants to answer is this: does the machine literally "understand" Chinese? Or is it merely simulating the ability to understand Chinese?[6][c] Searle calls the first position "strong AI" and the latter "weak AI".[d]

- If the input is a compute and desire output is a web page. People outside the room could tell forntend programmer from monkey immediately.
- If the input is all necessary components and desire output is an engine. People outside the room could tell engineer from monkey immediately.
- If the input is a data analysis problem and a calulator
- Give a monkey a computer, other human could tell it cannot design a web page, immediately.
- Give a monkey necessary components, other human could tell it cannot essemble an engine, immediately.
- Give a monkey a calculator, it can always somehow give a number, immediately. But it would take a while for other human to realise
